## About

PicoForge is a modern desktop application for configuring and managing Pico FIDO security keys. Built with Rust and GPUI, it provides an intuitive interface for:

- Reading device information and firmware details
- Configuring USB VID/PID and product names
- Adjusting LED settings (GPIO, brightness, driver)
- Managing security features (secure boot, firmware locking) (WIP)
- Real-time system logging and diagnostics
- Support for multiple hardware variants and vendors

> **Alpha Status**: This application is currently under active development and in alpha stage. Users should expect bugs and are encouraged to report them. The app has been tested on Linux and Windows 10 with the official Raspberry Pi Pico2 & ESP32-S3 and, currently supports Pico FIDO firmware version 7.2 only.

## Usage

1. Connect your smart card reader
2. Insert your Pico FIDO device
3. Launch PicoForge
4. Click **Refresh** button at top right corner to detect your key
5. Navigate through the sidebar to configure settings:
   - **Home** - Device overview and quick actions
   - **Configuration** - USB settings, LED options
   - **Security** - Secure boot management (experimental)
   - **Logs** - Real-time event monitoring
   - **About** - Application information

## Requirements

### Development Requirements

To contribute to PicoForge, you'll need:

- **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)** - System programming language (1.80+)
- **PC/SC Middleware**:
  - Linux: `pcscd` (usually pre-installed)
  - macOS: Built-in
  - Windows: Built-in

## Building from Source

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/librekeys/picoforge.git
cd picoforge
```

### 2. Build and Run

To run the application in development mode:

```bash
cargo run
```

To build for production:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The compiled binary will be available in `target/release/picoforge` (Linux/macOS) or `target/release/picoforge.exe` (Windows).

## Building and Development with Nix

[Nix](https://nixos.org/) provides developers with a complete and consistent development environment.

You can use Nix to build and develop picoforge painlessly.

### 1. Install Nix

Follow the [Installation Guide](https://nixos.org/download/#download-nix) and [NixOS Wiki](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Flakes#Setup) to install Nix and enable Flakes.

### 2. Build & Run

#### a. with Flakes

You can build and run PicoForge with a single command:

```bash
nix run github:librekeys/picoforge
```

Or simply build it and link to the current directory:

```bash
nix build github:librekeys/picoforge
```

> [!TIP]
> You can use our binary cache to save build time by allowing Nix to set extra-substitutes.

#### b. without Flakes

Download the package definition:

```bash
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/librekeys/picoforge/main/package.nix
```

Run the following command in the directory containing `package.nix`:

```bash
nix-build -E 'with import <nixpkgs> {}; callPackage ./package.nix { }'
```

The compiled binary will be available at: `result/bin/picoforge`

### 3. Develop

You can enter a developement environement with all the required dependencies.

#### a. with Flakes

```bash
nix develop github:librekeys/picoforge
```

#### b. without Flakes

You can use the `shell.nix` file that is at the root of the repository by running:

```bash
nix-shell
```

Then you can build from source and run the application with:

```bash
cargo run
```
