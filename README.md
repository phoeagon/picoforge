## About

PicoForge is a modern desktop application for configuring and managing Pico FIDO security keys. Built with Rust, Tauri, and Svelte, it provides an intuitive interface for:

- Reading device information and firmware details
- Configuring USB VID/PID and product names
- Adjusting LED settings (GPIO, brightness, driver)
- Managing security features (secure boot, firmware locking) (WIP)
- Real-time system logging and diagnostics
- Support for multiple hardware variants and vendors

> **Alpha Status**: This application is currently under active development and in alpha stage. Users should expect bugs and are encouraged to report them. The app has been tested on Linux and Windows 10 with the official Raspberry Pi Pico2 and currently supports Pico FIDO firmware version 7.2 only.
>
> The AppImage in the release builds have a lot of issues right now, I will fix them in the next or upcomming releases, till then you can either complie the app from source or use the .deb/.rpm versions from the releases.

## Requirements

### Development Requirements

To contribute to PicoForge, you'll need:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** - JavaScript/TypeScript runtime
- **[Deno](https://deno.land/)** - JavaScript/TypeScript runtime
- **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)** - System programming language (1.80+)
- **PC/SC Middleware**:
  - Linux: `pcscd` (usually pre-installed)
  - macOS: Built-in
  - Windows: Built-in

## Building from Source

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/librekeys/picoforge.git
cd picoforge
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
deno install
```

### 3. Build the Application

#### Development Build

```bash
deno task tauri dev
```

#### Production Build

```bash
deno task tauri build
```

The compiled binaries will be available in:
- **Linux**: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`
- **macOS**: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/dmg/`
- **Windows**: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`

### Platform-Specific Notes

#### Linux

Install PC/SC dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install libpcsclite-dev pcscd
```

Start the PC/SC daemon:

```bash
sudo systemctl start pcscd
sudo systemctl enable pcscd
```

#### macOS

No additional setup required. PC/SC framework is built-in.

#### Windows

Ensure Smart Card service is running:

```powershell
Get-Service SCardSvr | Start-Service
```

## Usage

1. Connect your smart card reader
2. Insert your Pico FIDO device
3. Launch PicoForge
4. Click **Refresh** button at top right corner to detect your key
5. Navigate through the sidebar to configure settings:
   - **Home** - Device overview and quick actions
   - **Configuration** - USB settings, LED options
   - **Security** - Secure boot management (experimental)
   - **Logs** - Real-time event monitoring
   - **About** - Application information

### Configuration Options

#### USB Identity
- **VID/PID** - Vendor and Product IDs (hex format)
- **Product Name** - Device name shown to host system
- **Vendor Presets** - Quick selection for common manufacturers

#### LED Settings
- **GPIO Pin** - Hardware pin for LED control
- **Brightness** - Intensity level (0-15)
- **Driver Type** - Hardware-specific LED drivers
- **Options** - Dimmable, steady mode, power cycle behavior

#### Advanced
- **Touch Timeout** - User presence button timeout (seconds)
- **Secp256k1** - Enable secp256k1 curve support
- **Secure Boot** - Firmware signature verification (⚠️ experimental and WIP)

## Disclaimer

> [!WARNING]
> PicoForge is experimental software and still in the Alpha stage! 
> The app does contain bugs and is not secure by any means.
>
> It does not support all the features exposed by the `pico-fido` firmware and `pico-hsm`.
>
> The secure boot feature can permanently lock devices if misconfigured. Always understand the implications before enabling security features.

> [!CAUTION]
> **USB VID/PID Notice**: The vendor presets provided in this software include USB Vendor IDs (VID) and Product IDs (PID) that are the intellectual property of their respective owners (Yubico, Nitrokey, FSIJ, Raspberry Pi Foundation, and others). These identifiers are included for testing and educational purposes only. You are NOT authorized to distribute or commercially market devices using VID/PID combinations you do not own or license. Commercial distribution requires obtaining your own VID from the USB Implementers Forum ([usb.org](https://www.usb.org/getting-vendor-id)) and complying with all applicable trademark and certification requirements. Unauthorized use may violate USB-IF policies and intellectual property laws. The PicoForge developers assume no liability for misuse of USB identifiers.
