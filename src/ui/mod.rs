//! NOTE: Hey this is me lockedmutex, right now the code quality of the entire ui module is shit okay, and this is because
//! AI has been used to convert most of the frontend code from svelte+typescript to GPUI, while it has done most of the conversion
//! due to lack in complete context of code and the way it is structured, it has done a shit job. I did make a lot of changes to
//! the code by myself so it is not complete AI slop. Right now I am trading development time with code quality, I will later
//! improve the code quality and correctly categorize the code into individial components.
